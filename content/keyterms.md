### Greenhouse Gas Emission
Gases in the atmosphere that trap heat and raise the temperature on earth. The production and consumption of fossil fuels release many different greenhouse gasses, the most common are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxide.

### Renewable Energy
Energy that is harnessed from natural processes that are replenished constantly, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

### Invest
