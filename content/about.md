title: About Us

Fossil Free NAU is a student-based organization that is working with student staff, faculty, alumni, and community members of Flagstaff to reach the goal of a fossil-free future. We here are just a chapter of a much larger movement striving for **divestment**.

Divestment is the opposite of investment. It means to pull invested money out of companies like Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron. These companies profit by exploiting natural resources and selling products that accelerate climate change. If we agree that climate change is doing harm all around the world, then itâ€™s wrong for us to profit off companies that continue to expand the fossil fuel economy. The divestment movement calls for the simple action of removing yourself as a shareholder in fossil fuel companies

### What are we doing?

We have written a letter asking the **Foundation board** to divest from the fossil fuel industry and align our investment policy with our values of environmental stewardship. University leadership has a responsibility to our community to consider not only the financial priorities of our endowment, but also the environmental and social impacts of our investments. NAU has a **strategic plan** that includes values to abide by, such as effective utilization of our financial resources with a commitment to the responsible use of environmental resources. With investments in the fossil fuel industry, our actions are not aligned with our commitments.

### Why are we a club?

Climate change is a human-caused phenomenon. The effects are being felt by communities all over the world, including our own. These effects will only amplify as time passes without meaningful climate action. Because of this, we are part of a collective that recognizes the climate crisis at hand and feels responsible for actively combating it.As students, we have the power to organize and demand change.

### Where do we meet?

We meet every Tuesday morning from 8:30-9:30 in the SBS West faculty lounge, room 202. Please join us!
