<main>
<p>Fossil Free NAU is a student-based organization that is working with student staff, faculty, alumni, and community members of Flagstaff to reach the goal of a fossil-free future. We here are just a chapter of a much larger movement striving for <strong>divestment</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h3>
<p>We have written a letter asking the <strong>Foundation board</strong> to remove their <strong>endowment</strong> investments from the fossil fuel industry and to reinvest in renewable energy. The university and its representatives have a responsibility to their community to protect us and our futures. NAU has a <strong>strategic plan</strong> that includes values to abide by; such as effective utilization of our financial resources with a commitment to the responsible use of environmental resources. With investments in the top 10 oil companies, their actions are not aligned with their commitments.</p>
<p>As students, we have the power to organize and demand change.</p>
<h3 id="why-are-we-a-club">Why are we a club?</h3>
<p>Climate change is a human-caused phenomenon. The effects are being felt by communities all over the world, including our own. These effects will only amplify as time passes without meaningful climate action. Because of this, we are part of a collective that recognizes the climate crisis at hand and feels responsible for actively combating it.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-we-meet">Where do we meet?</h3>
<p>We meet every Tuesday morning from 8:30-9:30 in the SBS West faculty lounge, room 202. Please join uu :)</p>
<h3 id="what-can-you-do">What can you do?</h3>
<p>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2rUWwhlmpTKK1G0pliGEW8WNCGbH7koF7B42uq20HuBPd7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link">sign our letter</a> to the foundation board asking for the divestment of fossil fuels at NAU.</p>
