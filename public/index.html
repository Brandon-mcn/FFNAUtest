<p>Climate Change is one of the most complex problems humanity has every faced, yet its root cause is plain and simple: <strong>The Fossil Fuel Economy.</strong> Burning oil, coal, and natural gas raises the atmospheric concentration of CO2, trapping more heat and increasing the risk of extreme weather events. 2024 was the <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-worlds-warmest-year-on-record" target="_blank"><b>hottest year on record</b></a> with our planet&rsquo;s 10 warmest years since 1850 all occurring in the past decade. We are dealing with a <a href="https://www.unep.org/facts-about-climate-emergency" target="_blank"><b>climate emergency.</b></a></p>
<p>Oil and gas companies want you to think they are part of the solution, but history shows they have acted as agents of misinformation, diversion, and distraction - all in the name of maintaining the fossil fuel economy.</p>
<ul>
<li><b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>ExxonMobile</strong></b> knew that global warming was caused by its fossil fuel products <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abk0063" target="_blank"><b>as far back as the 1970s</b></a>, yet they would go on to spend the following decades spreading doubt and uncertainty around climate science.</li>
<li><b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>Shell</strong></b> has been accused of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/02/01/oil-giant-shell-accused-greenwashing-misleading-investors/" target="_blank"><b>lying about its spending on renewable energy</b></a>, misleading investors and engaging in blatant greenwashing.</li>
<li><b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>Chevron</strong></b>, which acquired Texaco in 2001, is responsible for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/08/chevron-amazon-ecuador-steven-donziger-erin-brockovich" target="_blank"><b>26 years of devastating pollution in the Ecuadorian Amazon</b></a>, however they haven&rsquo;t paid a single cent towards clean up costs and instead spend millions of dollars on legal fees to avoid accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you might be thinking what does Northern Arizona Univeristy have to do with any of this, and you may be surprised to know that <strong>our endowment has millions of dollars invested in fossil fuel companies</strong>, including the three above. Our endowment is managed by the <a href="https://www.foundationnau.org/s/1898/custom19/interior.aspx?sid=1898&gid=2&pgid=667" target="_blank"><b>NAU Foundation Board</b></a> which makes little, if any, consideration to the environmental damages caused by companies we invest in. NAU remains a shareholder <b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>ExxonMobile</strong></b>, <b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>Shell</strong></b>, <b style="color:#d4600a;"><strong>Chevron</strong></b>, and many other companys that fight to maintain the fossil fuel economy.</p>
<p>Fossil Free NAU is a student-based organization fighting for <strong>divestment from the fossil fuel industry</strong> and other companies that pump vast amounts of greenhouse gas pollution into our atmosphere. We believe it&rsquo;s wrong for NAU to remain a shareholder in the fossil fuel industry while actively pursing a <a href="https://nau.edu/president/strategic-plan/#dynamic-link-5" target="_blank"><b>Climate Action Plan</b></a> that calls for carbon neutral operations by 2030. It&rsquo;s time for NAU to be true to our values of environmental stewardship and divest from fossil fuels!</p>
<p>You can support our movement by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd2rUWwhlmpTKK1G0pliGEW8WNCGbH7koF7B42uq20HuBPd7Q/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank"><b>signing our letter</b></a> and adding your name to the growing list of students, faculty, staff, alumni and other Flagstaff community members who believe it&rsquo;s wrong that we profit off the fossil fuel industry while claiming values of environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>Learn more about our <a href="/objectives"><strong>divestment objectives</strong></a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Divest from the top 200 coal and oil/gas reserve owners</li>
<li>Evaluate all carbon-intensive companies for the existence and quality of a low-carbon transition plan</li>
<li>Gather feedback from NAU students, faculty, alumni, and staff on priorities for a socially responsible investment (SRI) policy</li>
<li>Disclose endowment holdings and investment policy annually</li>
